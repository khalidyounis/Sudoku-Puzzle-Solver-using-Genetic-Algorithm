# Sudoku Puzzle Solver using Genetic Algorithm

## Background

Software application that solves a puzzle game similar to **Sudoku** using genetic algorithms. The objective is to fill a grid of size 4x4 with four different letters so that each column, each row, and each of the four sub-grids of size 2x2 contain each of the letters only once. It was developed for the CSCK502 Reasoning and Intelligent Systems October 2022 End-Module group assignment at the University of Liverpool.

## Usage

1. You can launch the application using one of these methods

	**a.** Go to the dist folder in the source code directory and double-click the jar file

			SPGA.jar
	**b.** Run the application from the command line, go to the dist folder and type the following command:

			java -jar "SPGA.jar" 	
			
2. To resolve the puzzle, the user is asked to input the word with four unique letters. The application verifies the word against the number of characters, which should be four and unique. The user can also Skip entering the four letters manually in the grid boxes:
